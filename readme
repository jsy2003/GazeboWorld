Two ways for simulating in Gazebo

1. SDF : Simulation Description Format(SDF) is an XML description file used to describe objects and environments for robotic simulations and control.
         From robots to the whole world, one can create man y things using the SDF format.
         We will use SDF to define a simulated world
         
 2. URDF : Unified Robot Description Forfmat(URDF) is also an XML file, however, can be used to create single robotic instance.
           But provides for ROS integration which is what we want for future robot control.
           We will use URDF to define the robot model.
